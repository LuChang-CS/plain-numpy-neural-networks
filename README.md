# Plain Numpy Neural Networks

This is a project to implement basic neural networks including logistic regression (LR), multiple layer perceptron (MLP), recurrent neural networks (RNN), and convolutinal neural networks (CNN), etc.

We aim to help you obtain a deeper comprehension towards neural networks, back-propagation, and auto-grad, etc.
